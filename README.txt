CS 7/4641 - Machine Learning
Project 3
Code here: https://github.com/ewang73/proj3

Datasets are loaded from SciKitLearn, originally from UCI Repository
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html
Iris Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset

This project was done through a combination of SciKitLearn and WEKA.
Proper installation for both is required, including but not limited to:
    -Python 3
    -matplotlib
    -pyplot
    -scikit-learn
    -scikit-plot
    -numpy
    -pandas
    -Java 8
    -WEKA

Most of the python code is labeled in this format:
    -datasetCLUSTERreduction.py
        eg. irisEMpca.py
WEKA was used to apply reduction filters to datasets and generate csv files.
